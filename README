Task 4.2: Plug-Controller
======================

Compile using
gcc plug.c -o plug

Task 4.3: App
======================

Due to better portability and availability on more devices, we opted to develop the communicator client as a web-Application.
Once the server has been started on the raspberry, all devices capable of running a browser can access the switches.

Its developed in python 3 with cherrypy. Simply run 
sudo pip install cherrypy
and then execute server.py.

The webinterface can be accessed by pointing your browser to https://<raspberry-ip>:8080
https needs to be explicitly specified, since its not possible to serve both http and https on the same port using cherrypy.

The webApp uses the HTTP-Digest algorithm for login, and will ask for credentials once you load it.
The currently set login is:
user: comsyslab
pw: SecureAF

The server expects the corresponding plug executable to be in the same directory as server.py, so make sure to copy it over once you've built it.

All settings of the server (including switches etc) are stored in settings.json.
